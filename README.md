# Odin Calculator

This is the last project of [The Odin Project's Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) curriculum.

This calculator takes in user input by clicking the buttons or pressing keys on the keyboard.

The screen can be cleared entirely with the "Clear" button or one character can be erased at a time with the "Backspace" button.

For now, the calculator supports left to right calculation so `12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = 42`, as opposed to 4 which would be the mathematically correct answer.

If the result of a calculation has many decimal places, it is rounded to five decimal places at most.

The calculator lets the user know if an invalid input is entered, such as `*+1`.
